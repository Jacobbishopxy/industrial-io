# IndustrialIO

An industrial chain app by using MongoDB as Graph Database

## Concepts

According to mongoDB official documentation, a graph database has four main concepts:

> - **Nodes (or vertices)**: You can think of nodes as the nouns in your databases; they store information about people, places, and things.
> - **Edges (or relationships)**: You can think of edges as the verbs in your databases; they store information about the actions that are taken between the nodes.
> - **Properties**: A property is a key-value pair that stores information about a particular node or edge.
> - **Labels**: A label can optionally be used to tag a group of related nodes.
